TeXcount
========

A [Sublime Text 2 and 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) package to provide access to [TeXcount](http://app.uio.no/ifi/texcount/) from a simple keyboard shortcut: `cmd+l, w` on OS X, and `ctrl+l, w` on Linux and Windows.

Credits
------------
This package was created by [Ben Sowden](https://github.com/bensowden), with modifications made by [Matthew Bedder](https://github.com/bedder) to make it work in Windows. These edits may have actually broken it in Linux or OS X. Sorry if that's the case.

Installation
------------

Checkout to Sublime Text 2/3 Packages folder, which can be found by executing the command `sublime.packages_path()` in the Sublime Text console.
